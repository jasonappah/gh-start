# gh-start
(WIP) A Rust extension for the GitHub CLI to start new repos from starred template repos

## Contributing
This is my first Rust project, so please feel free to let me know via an issue/PR if I'm not following a certain best practice or if there's a way I could write something more idiomatically.

### Developing
This needs to be built with the nightly version of Rust for now - make sure you have a regular install of Rust, then to set up a nightly build, run `rustup toolchain install nightly`. Then, run `cargo +nightly run` to build and run the CLI once, or `cargo +nightly build` to build a binary.
